TaskedUp - a task management system
Run InstallerV5.exe to install the app locally.
You have several usage ways -
you can open the run dialog box {press the windows key and the R key}, type taskedup and hit enter.
It will run the currently installed TaskedUp version.
You can also type taskedapp instead.
If you want to make sure you're using the latest version, you can type taskedupfull, 
which will fetch the latest version of the TaskedUp app from git {git installation is not required} and run it.
Notice - the installation creates a scheduled task, that will update your version at 10:00 AM daily {which takes 5~ seconds}.
In case you want to use the first version you installed - you can type taskedupfirst, which will use the earliest version installed on you system
You can also go to C:\TaskedUp and use the files in there directly.

TaskedUp is written in GO for fast and high performance
The runner app (TaskedUp.bat) is using the common windows automation script language, which is also fast
Hopefully the speed will work for you!
Feel free to suggest new ideas and features!
