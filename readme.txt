TaskedUp - a task management system
Run TaskedUpInstaller.exe to install the app locally.
You have several usage ways -
you can open the run dialog box {press the windows key and the R key}, type taskedup and hit enter.
It will fetch the latest version of the TaskedUp app from git {git installation is not required} and run it.
you can also type taskedapp instead, which will use the currently installed version {without updating it, recommended if you don't need any update at the moment}.
you can also go to C:\TaskedUp and use the files in there directly.

TaskedUp is written in GO for fast and high performance
The runner app (TaskedUp.bat) is using the common windows automation script language, which is also fast
Hopefully the speed will work for you!
feel free to suggest new ideas and features!
